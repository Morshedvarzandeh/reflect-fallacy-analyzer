# Reflect: AI-Powered Fallacy Checker

This is a free and humanitarian tool to help people recognize cognitive distortions, fallacies, or negative thinking patterns in their thoughts â€” and gently reframe them.

## How it works

1. You write a thought.
2. AI checks if it's distorted or rational.
3. If distorted, it labels the fallacy, explains it, and gives a healthier reframe.
4. All responses are saved to a clean log file.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Termux (or any terminal with Python)
- An API key from [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)

## Run it

```bash
python reflect.py
